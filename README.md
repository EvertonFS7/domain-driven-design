# Domain

The **domain** refers to a set of concepts, rules, processes, and behaviors that are fundamental to a specific business or application. It is the knowledge area that describes and organizes all the necessary knowledge and understanding to develop software that meets the business or application's needs.

The domain serves as the foundation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), shaping the construction of business models. It consists of entities, aggregates, services, and events that represent fundamental business concepts. Domain knowledge is essential for developers to comprehend business needs and construct software efficiently and effectively.

DDD emphasizes clear and constant communication between developers and domain experts (also known as domain experts), ensuring that domain knowledge is shared and integrated into the software development process.

## Entities

Entities are domain objects representing significant business concepts. They encapsulate the state and behavior related to these concepts, playing a crucial role in domain modeling.

An entity is characterized by a unique and constant identity that sets it apart from other entities of the same type.

Entities are vital in DDD as they represent the primary abstractions of the domain. Proper modeling ensures that the software accurately reflects business rules and behavior. Entities often serve as the entry point for system operations such as validations, calculations, and specific business rules.

## Use Cases

Use cases are a technique for describing the functional requirements of a system. They depict a specific interaction between the user and the system, outlining user actions and the system's responses.

Use cases are integral to the software development process, defining system requirements and ensuring alignment with end-user needs.

## Ubiquitous Language

Ubiquitous language is a technique involving the use of a common language comprehensible to both developers and domain experts. It describes and understands domain concepts and processes.

This technique aligns communication between development teams and domain experts, fostering shared understanding of domain terms and key concepts. Ubiquitous language should be embedded in source code and related documents, promoting consistent terminology usage across all project stakeholders.

## Aggregates

An aggregate is a collection of domain objects treated as a cohesive unit. Aggregates are employed to define consistent state-changing transactions within the domain.

An aggregate has an aggregate root, a single entity responsible for ensuring aggregate consistency. The aggregate root is the only entity accessible from outside the aggregate, while other entities within the aggregate can only be accessed through the aggregate root.

Aggregates are a key technique for managing complexity in DDD-based software systems. By defining aggregate boundaries, a clearer and focused domain model with well-defined transactions and responsibilities for each object within the aggregate can be created.

## Bounded Context

Bounded Context is a technique for explicitly defining boundaries around a set of domain models. Each Bounded Context is a logical boundary separating a specific domain model with its own rules, terms, and limits from other domain models within the same system.

Bounded Context can be seen as a subdomain or sector of a larger system, where interactions between domain objects are highly related. It helps avoid confusion between different business concepts, reduces code duplication, and simplifies the system's complexity. Each Bounded Context may have its architecture, design patterns, and technologies, allowing the development team to choose tools tailored to the context's specifics.

DDD encourages clear communication and collaboration between different Bounded Contexts, through well-defined integrations and clear agreements on how domain objects will be shared between contexts.

Establishing Bounded Contexts is a crucial part of modeling a DDD-based system, requiring close collaboration between the development team and domain experts to ensure well-defined and understood context boundaries.

## Value Objects

A Value Object is a class representing a value important to the domain but lacking its own identity. It is defined by its attributes rather than a unique identity.

For example, in an online shopping system, an Address can be modeled as a Value Object since it doesn't require a unique identifier. Instead, its attributes, such as street, number, neighborhood, city, state, and ZIP code, define its significance. From a business perspective, an address is merely information that needs to be stored and queried, not an entity that requires tracking or management.

However, it's crucial to note that not all identity-lacking objects are necessarily Value Objects. The decision to model an object as a Value Object depends on the domain context and analysis by business experts and the development team.

## Domain Events

A Domain Event is an asynchronous notification indicating that something significant has occurred in the system's domain. It represents an event within the system that may be of interest to other parts, potentially influencing decisions or triggering new actions.

For instance, in an e-commerce system, a domain event could be generated when a new purchase is successfully completed. This event may contain information such as the purchase identifier, total value, delivery address, and other relevant domain information.

Domain events are crucial as they allow different parts of the system to be notified and updated when important changes occur in the domain. They also enable a more modular and scalable system design, as different parts of the system can be designed to react independently to various event types.
